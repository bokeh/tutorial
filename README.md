# Bokeh tutorial notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bokeh/tutorial/main?filepath=notebooks%2F01_introduction.ipynb)

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks.
These notebooks are available as an interactive tutorial at
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bokeh/tutorial/main?filepath=notebooks%2F01_introduction.ipynb

To learn about Bokeh, please use the tutorial on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bokeh/tutorial/main?filepath=notebooks%2F01_introduction.ipynb).

You can also [install and run the notebooks on a local machine](#local-setup).
This is helpful if you can't access mybinder.org, or if you want to
[contribute to this tutorial](#contributing-to-this-tutorial).

## Local setup

To run the tutorial locally, first clone this repository to your local machine.
For example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bokeh/tutorial.git
```

After cloning the repository, enter the folder that contains the repository contents:

```bash
cd tutorial
```

Next, you need to set up your environment. This tutorial uses the `conda` package
manager.
Please make sure
[conda or Miniconda are installed and configured correctly](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/)
on your system.

Run the following command inside your local repository folder to create your environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After the environment is set up, activate it with the following command:

```bash
conda activate bk-tutorial
```

Before opening the tutorial notebooks, you need to install the Bokeh sampledata.
Make sure the ``bk-tutorial`` environment is activated, then run the following command:

```bash
bokeh sampledata
```

From inside the  ``bk-tutorial`` environment, you can now start the Jupyter notebook
server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

After opening Jupyter notebooks in a browser, go to the folder `notebooks`.
Open the first notebook in this folder. It is called `01_introduction.ipynb`.
