## Setup for SciPy US 2024

This tutorial will be presented at the SciPy 2024 conference, where you can use Nebari (JupterHub) hosted at [scipy.quansight.dev](https://scipy.quansight.dev/) to follow along.

Follow [this participant's guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YWMZKW6Y4tXnMs3Jekc1S7BQWTR6THZazDaq3WoNxw/edit?usp=sharing) to register, sign-in, and download the tutorial materials.

In the `tutorials/tutorial` folder that's created with all material, navigate to the `notebooks` folder, and open `01_introduction.ipynb`.

The environment for this tutorial is `scipy-scipy-interactive-dataviz-bokeh`, and it is automatically selected for you.

### SciPy US 2023

This tutorial was presented live during the SciPy 2023 conference. The state of the repository, as presented, can be accessed through the designated git tag, available [here](https://github.com/bokeh/tutorial/releases/tag/SciPy2023).

Additionally, the tutorial presentation is accessible on YouTube via the following link: https://youtu.be/G0Yc3ck4lC8?si=ZGqatTPnZBwjtdXO

## Local setup

Follow these steps to run the tutorial notebooks on your local machine:

1. To run the tutorial locally, first **clone** this repository to your local machine.
    For example:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:bokeh/tutorial.git
    ```

2. After cloning the repository, **enter the folder** that contains the repository contents:

    ```bash
    cd tutorial
    ```

3. Next, you need to **set up your environment**. This tutorial uses the `conda` package
    manager.
    Please make sure
    [conda or Miniconda are installed and configured correctly](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/)
    on your system.

    Run the following command inside your local repository folder to create your environment:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

4. After the environment is set up, **activate** it with the following command:

    ```bash
    conda activate bk-tutorial
    ```

5. Before opening the tutorial notebooks, you need to **install the Bokeh sampledata**.
    Make sure the ``bk-tutorial`` environment is activated, then run the following command:

    ```bash
    bokeh sampledata
    ```

6. From inside the  ``bk-tutorial`` environment, you can now **start the Jupyter
    notebook server**:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

7. After opening Jupyter notebooks in a browser, go to the folder `notebooks`.
    **Open the first notebook in this folder**. It is called
    `01_introduction.ipynb`.
