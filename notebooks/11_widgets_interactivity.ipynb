    "Let's walk through the details of how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, it is important to **assign a variable name to the circle\n",
    "glyphs**.\n",
    "In most previous examples, you just called a method to add a glyph to a plot.\n",
    "For example: `p.scatter(x=x, y=y)`.\n",
    "In order for `js_link()` to work, you need to be able to reference the glyph.\n",
    "For this reason, you need to assign a variable name when you call the glyph method.\n",
    "For example: `circles = p.scatter(x=x, y=y)`.\n",
    "This allows you to **reference this glyph renderer later in your code**. The glyphs\n",
    "themselves are accessible through the **`glyph` attribute of a glyph renderer**.\n",
    "For example: `circles.glyph`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you can access the circle glyph and its properties, let's look at the\n",
    "line where you call the `js_link()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "slider.js_link(\"value\", circles.glyph, \"size\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the `js_link()` method is called on the object you want to read the data\n",
    "from. This is the **source object**.\n",
    "In this case, you want to read data from the ``slider`` object.\n",
    "This is why the `js_link()` method is called on ``slider``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `js_link()` method takes three parameters:\n",
    "1. The name of the **property to read from the source object**. In this case, you want to\n",
    "   read the current value of the slider. This value is stored in the slider's ``value``\n",
    "   property.\n",
    "2. The object you want to write data to. This is the **target object**. In this case,\n",
    "   you are writing values to the ``circle`` glyph object. The properties of a glyph\n",
    "   renderer's glyphs are accessible through the ``glyph`` attribute. This is why you use\n",
    "   ``circles.glyph``.\n",
    "3. The specific **property of the target object you want to write to**. In this case,\n",
    "   you want to change the ``size`` property of the circle glyphs. This is why you use\n",
